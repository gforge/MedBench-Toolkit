# The MedBench toolkit (Deprecated)

This repo is for aiding in aiding interaction with the MedBench medical charts. This for:

-   Translation
-   Evaluation
-   Writing cases

See https://gforge.github.io/MedBench-Toolkit/ for a live version of the translation tool.

Note that the toolkit does not save to a database but locally in your browser. If you want to migrate between computers/browsers you need to save your work by exporting a .mbc file (JSON dump) and then import it in the new browser.
